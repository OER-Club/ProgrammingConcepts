(A)Introcuction to Programming :Algorithms & Flow charts (10 examples each)

1.  Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room.
The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are 
more comfortable working with.  (M & K -Done)
2. The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip
for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). 
The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip. 
Format the output so that all the values are displayed using two decimal places. (Edom -Done)


(B)If statement: Algorithms & Flow charts (10 examples each)

1. Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300 years ago. His algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers, a and b, 
is both efficient and recursive. It is outlined below: 
   If b is 0 then  
     Return a  
   Else  
     Set c equal to the remainder when a is divided by b  
     Return the greatest common divisor of b and c 
  Write a program that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm and uses it to determine the greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user. 
  Use the below sections for preparing the tutorial. (Jessica -Done)
